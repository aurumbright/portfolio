# 02 Module Challenge: Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Portfolio description

This is a personal portfolio that includes preview images and links to examples of my work. It also includes links for getting in touch with me, including a telephone number, email, and my LinkedIn and GitHub pages. There is a short description of who I am and my interests, as well as a profile photo. The page adapts to screen sizes, moving links to a more easily-viewed list view and moving the items in each section to block display as the screen size shrinks.

## Preview

The following animation shows the portfolio's appearance and functionality:

## Notes

* Future updates to this page will include optimizing the CSS grid and flexbox to improve layout and flow as work examples increase.


## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
